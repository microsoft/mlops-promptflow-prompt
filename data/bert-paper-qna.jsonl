{"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf", "chat_history":[], "question": "What is the name of the new language representation model introduced in the document?", "answer": "BERT", "context": "We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers."}
{"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf", "chat_history":[], "question": "What is the main difference between BERT and previous language representation models?", "answer": "BERT is designed to pretrain deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers.", "context": "Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pretrain deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers."}
{"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf", "chat_history":[], "question": "What is the advantage of fine-tuning BERT over using feature-based approaches?", "answer": "Fine-tuning BERT reduces the need for many heavily-engineered taskspecific architectures and transfers all parameters to initialize end-task model parameters.", "context": "We show that pre-trained representations reduce the need for many heavily-engineered taskspecific architectures. BERT is the first finetuning based representation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on a large suite of sentence-level and token-level tasks, outperforming many task-specific architectures."}
{"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf", "chat_history":[], "question": "What are the two unsupervised tasks used to pre-train BERT?", "answer": "Masked LM and next sentence prediction", "context": "In order to train a deep bidirectional representation, we simply mask some percentage of the input tokens at random, and then predict those masked tokens. We refer to this procedure as a \"masked LM\" (MLM), although it is often referred to as a Cloze task in the literature (Taylor, 1953). In addition to the masked language model, we also use a \"next sentence prediction\" task that jointly pretrains text-pair representations."}
{"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf", "chat_history":[], "question": "How does BERT handle single sentence and sentence pair inputs?", "answer": "It uses a special classification token ([CLS]) at the beginning of every input sequence and a special separator token ([SEP]) to separate sentences or mark the end of a sequence.", "context": "To make BERT handle a variety of down-stream tasks, our input representation is able to unambiguously represent both a single sentence and a pair of sentences (e.g., h Question, Answeri) in one token sequence. The first token of every sequence is always a special classification token ([CLS]). The final hidden state corresponding to this token is used as the aggregate sequence representation for classification tasks. Sentence pairs are packed together into a single sequence. We differentiate the sentences in two ways. First, we separate them with a special token ([SEP]). Second, we add a learned embedding to every token indicating whether it belongs to sentence A or sentence B."}
{"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf", "chat_history":[], "question": "What are the three types of embeddings used to construct the input representation for BERT?", "answer": "Token embeddings, segment embeddings and position embeddings", "context": "For a given token, its input representation is constructed by summing the corresponding token, segment, and position embeddings. A visualization of this construction can be seen in Figure 2."}
{"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf", "chat_history":[], "question": "What is the size of the vocabulary used by BERT?", "answer": "30,000", "context": "We use WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al., 2016) with a 30,000 token vocabulary."}

{"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf", "chat_history":[], "question": "How does BERT predict the start and end positions of an answer span in SQuAD?", "answer": "It uses two vectors S and E whose dot products with the final hidden vectors of each token denote scores for start and end positions.", "context": "We only introduce a start vector S ∈ R H and an end vector E ∈ R H during fine-tuning. The probability of word i being the start of the answer span is computed as a dot product between Ti and S followed by a softmax over all of the words in the paragraph: Pi = e S·Ti P j e S·Tj . The analogous formula is used for the end of the answer span."}
