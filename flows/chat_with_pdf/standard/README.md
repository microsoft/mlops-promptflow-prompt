# Chat with PDF

This is a simple flow that allow you to ask questions about the content of a PDF file and get answers.
You can run the flow with a URL to a PDF file and question as argument.
Once it's launched it will download the PDF and build an index of the content. 
Then when you ask a question, it will look up the index to retrieve relevant content and post the question with the relevant content to OpenAI chat model (gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt4) to get an answer.

Tools used in this flowï¼š
- custom `python` Tool

## Prerequisites

Install promptflow sdk and other dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Get started
### Create connection in this folder

```bash
# create connection needed by flow
if pf connection list | grep open_ai_connection; then
    echo "open_ai_connection already exists"
else
    pf connection create --file ../../../connections/azure_openai.yml --name open_ai_connection --set api_key=<your_api_key> api_base=<your_api_base>
fi
```

### CLI Example

#### Run flow

**Note**: this sample uses [predownloaded PDFs](./chat_with_pdf/.pdfs/) and [prebuilt FAISS Index](./chat_with_pdf/.index/) to speed up execution time.
You can remove the folders to start a fresh run.

```bash
# test with default input value in flow.dag.yaml
pf flow test --flow .

# test with flow inputs
pf flow test --flow . --inputs question="What is the name of the new language representation model introduced in the document?" pdf_url="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf"

# (Optional) create a random run name
run_name="web_classification_"$(openssl rand -hex 12)

# run with multiline data, --name is optional
pf run create --file batch_run.yaml --name $run_name

# visualize run output details
pf run visualize --name $run_name
```

#### Submit run to cloud

Assume we already have a connection named `open_ai_connection` in workspace.

```bash
# set default workspace
az account set -s <your_subscription_id>
az configure --defaults group=<your_resource_group_name> workspace=<your_workspace_name>
```

``` bash
# create run
pfazure run create --file batch_run.yaml --name $run_name
```

Note: Click portal_url of the run to view the final snapshot.
